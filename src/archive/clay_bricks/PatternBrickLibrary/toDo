## to-do list

clay extrusion

• different nozzle size
    - larger, less layers, to make it run quicker

grasshopper

• clean up the file logic
    - make grasshopper loading independent from who uses it                     Done
    - clean up the amount of files & organize a couple of them                  
    - streamline the Workflow
        * geometry selection
        * shell, pin, layer logic
        * trimming/intersecting logic
